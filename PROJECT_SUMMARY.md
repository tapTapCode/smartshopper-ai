# 🏆 SmartShopper AI - Cloud Run Hackathon Project Summary

## Project Title
**SmartShopper AI: GPU-Powered Visual Product Search**

## Category
**⚡ GPU Category** - Using NVIDIA L4 GPUs on Google Cloud Run

---

## 📝 One-Line Description
An intelligent shopping assistant that uses GPU-accelerated CLIP embeddings and Gemini Vision API to find similar products through image upload, deployed on Google Cloud Run with L4 GPUs.

---

## ✨ Key Innovation
Combining open-source CLIP model running on L4 GPUs with Google's Gemini Vision API to deliver **sub-3-second visual product search** at serverless scale.

---

## 🎯 What We Built

### Core Features
1. **GPU-Accelerated Visual Search**
   - Upload any product image
   - CLIP model generates embeddings in <100ms on L4 GPU
   - Find visually similar products using cosine similarity
   - Real-time results with drag-and-drop interface

2. **Gemini Vision Integration**
   - Automatic product attribute extraction
   - Identifies colors, style, brand, category from images
   - Enriches search results with AI insights

3. **Traditional Search & Chat**
   - Elasticsearch-powered text search
   - Conversational AI assistant using Vertex AI
   - Redis caching for performance

### Technology Highlights
- **CLIP (ViT-B/32)** - Open-source vision model on GPU
- **Flask API** - REST endpoints for all features
- **Cloud Run** - Serverless with L4 GPU support
- **Gemini Vision** - Advanced image understanding
- **Docker** - Multi-stage GPU-optimized builds

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

```
User → Frontend (Upload Image) → Cloud Run (L4 GPU) → CLIP Embeddings
                                        ↓
                                   Similarity Search → Results
                                        ↓
                                   Gemini Vision → AI Analysis
```

**Why GPU is Critical:**
- CPU inference: ~1000ms per image ❌
- GPU inference: ~50-100ms per image ✅
- **10x faster** = Real-time user experience
